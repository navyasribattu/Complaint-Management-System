# Complaint Management System

##  Project Description

The Complaint Management System is a console-based Java application designed to allow users to register, track, and resolve complaints efficiently. The system provides a simple and intuitive menu-driven interface where users can manage complaints easily.

This project demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java such as encapsulation, classes, and objects.
